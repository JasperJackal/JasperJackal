- 👋 Hi, I’m @JasperJackal
- 👀 I’m (almost) a bona-fide pensioner. My interest in computers began at school way back in the 70s. However, I failed all my exams and joined the military instead. Picked up computing again on leaving the Service in the early 90s and now build and maintain my own gaming rig. Always had this thing about coding and so...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...python. Took the plunge last week and started the 100 days of coding. At the time of writing I am part way through day 2. I figure with work commitmens etc, it'll take me about a year to complete.
- 💞️ I’m (not really )looking to collaborate on anything currently but that may change as me experience and knowledge develops.
- 📫 How to reach me ...right here for now
